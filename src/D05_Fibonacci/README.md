Whiteboarding Challenges

# Matrix Rotation
rotate a 3x3 matrix (an array of integers), by 90 degrees clockwise.
Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.

## Challenge
See summary above. Working with 2D arrays and learning to traverse them to achieve different goals.

## Solution
In this challenge we didn't write on a whiteboard, but rather created this in the IDE.
I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.

Class Outline
Interview 01
Rotate a matrix.

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully.
Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate a code challenge
Score the candidate according to the Whiteboard Rubric
You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond), but don’t solve it for the candidate
Feature Tasks
Ask the candidate to write a function to rotate a 3x3 matrix (an array of integers), by 90 degrees clockwise.
Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.
Don’t let the candidate get scared by the term “matrix”… It’s just an array of arrays.
Structure
Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview.

Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available.

Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to at least convince you that their code works to solve the problem.

Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.

Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page.

Example
Input	Output
[ [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3] ]	[ [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1] ]
[ [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1] ]	[ [3, 3, 3], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1] ]
The candidate should draw the input and output as a square of integers.
