# Overview

Create a breadth traversal method for a binary tree that does not use any built in methods. You can assume the tree 
is made of positive integers only. 

## Challenge
Rebuild our custom Queue class with enqueue and dequeue methods to help the newly created breadth traversal function 
complete it's task and to complete this challenge.

## Solution
In this challenge, I white boarded on my tablet and then coded in the IDE.

I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.

#DOCUMENTATION
##Code Challenge
##Breadth-first Traversal.

##Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called breadth-first-traversal
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a method named BreadthFirst() outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a file called breadth-first-traversal.js
Python: a file called breadth_first_traversal.py
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function called breadthFirstTraversal which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited node’s value.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
