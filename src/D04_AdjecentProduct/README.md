Whiteboarding Challenges

# Adjacent product
Without using any built-in methods, write a function that returns the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array.

## Challenge
See summary above. Working with 2D arrays and learning to traverse them to achieve different goals.

## Solution
In this challenge we didn't write on a whiteboard, but rather created this in the IDE.
I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.
