# Overview

Create a method that finds the maximum value in a node of a binary tree. Assume all values are whole integers. 

## Challenge
Build a new recursive method that finds the maximum value of a node within a binary tree.

## Solution
In this challenge, I white boarded on my tablet and then coded in the IDE.

I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.

#DOCUMENTATION
##Code Challenge
##Find Max of Binary Tree
Code Challenge
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called find-maximum-value-binary-tree
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a method named FindMax() outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a file called find-maximum-value-binary-tree.js
Python: a file called find_maximum_value_binary_tree.py
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only imput. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
