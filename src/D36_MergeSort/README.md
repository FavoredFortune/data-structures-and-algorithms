# Overview

Create a method that joins two hashmaps as a LEFT join (like in SQL)

## Challenge
Build a new method that returns a single hashmaps with a single set of keys and values from both provided hashtables. 

## Solution
In this challenge, I white boarded on my tablet and then coded in the IDE.
NOTE: code & test works only in new project - copies of code for both are here, but must be put into a new project to
 work.

I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.

#DOCUMENTATION
#Code Challenge
Implement Mergesort.

##Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called mergesort
On your branch, create…
C#: Inside of your Program.cs file, create a method named MergeSort() outside of Main(). Call Your newly created method in main once complete.
JavaScript: a file called mergesort.js
Python: a file called mergesort.py
Java: a file called MergeSort.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.

##Feature Tasks
Write a function that accepts an array of unsorted integers, and returns a sorted array by a recursive mergesort algorithm.

##Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

##Example
###Input	                                Output
[34, 19, 42, -9, 2018, 0, 2005, 77, 2099]	[-9, 0, 19, 34, 42, 77, 2005, 2018, 2099]
##Stretch Goals
Consider a data set that is roughly already sorted. How can you optimize your algorithm to improve performace?

##Submission Instructions
Take a photo of your completed whiteboard, matching the example whiteboard layout
Copy your photo into an /assets directory in your repo
Give the image file the same name as the branch you are working on
Embed the image in your README.md documentation
Create a pull request from your branch to your master branch
In your open pull request, leave as a comment a checklist of the specifications and tasks above, with the actual steps that you completed checked off
Submitting your completed work to Canvas:
Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the corresponding Canvas assignment
Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box
Add any additional comments you like about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment
Merge your branch into master, and delete your branch (don’t worry, the PR link will still work)
