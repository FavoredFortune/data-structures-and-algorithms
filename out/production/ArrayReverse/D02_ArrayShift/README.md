# Shift an Array
Without using any built-in methods, write a function takes an array, and a value to be added and returns a new array with the new value included at the middle of the index.

## Challenge
See summary above under Shift on Array

## Solution
In this challenge we didn't write on a whiteboard, but rather created this in the IDE.
I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.
