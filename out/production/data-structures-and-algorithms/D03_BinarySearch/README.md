Whiteboarding Challenges

# Binary Search
Without using any built-in methods, write a function  that takes a sorted array and returns the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to a search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge
See summary above under Binary Search overview

## Solution
In this challenge we didn't write on a whiteboard, but rather created this in the IDE.
I also built a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.
