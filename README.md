Whiteboarding Challenges

# Reverse an Array
Without using any built-in methods, write a function that reverses an array.

## Challenge
See summary above under Revers on Array

## Solution
In this first challenge we didn't write on a whiteboard, but rather created this java object ArrayReverse with the reverseArray method.
While not noted in the assignment, per instructions in class, we are also meant to build a test that properly tests the function for several uses cases.
